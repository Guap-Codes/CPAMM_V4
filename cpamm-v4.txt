Let's dive into the project architecture design, file folder structure, and dependencies for your Constant Product Automated Market Maker (CP-AMM) project using Uniswap V4:

Project Architecture Design

The project architecture will consist of the following components:

Smart Contracts

- CPAMM.sol: The main CP-AMM smart contract that implements the constant product formula and handles swapping, adding, and removing liquidity.
- UniswapV4Pair.sol: A modified version of the Uniswap V4 pair contract that integrates with the CP-AMM logic.
- CPAMMFactory.sol: A factory contract that creates new CP-AMM pair contracts.

the Constant Product Automated Market Maker (CP-AMM) project may require periphery contracts to interact with the Uniswap V4 protocol and provide additional functionality. Here are some examples of periphery contracts that may be required:

1. Router Contract: A router contract is responsible for routing trades between the CP-AMM contract and other Uniswap V4 pairs. The router contract will handle the logic for finding the best trade route and executing the trade.
2. Factory Contract: A factory contract is responsible for creating new CP-AMM pairs. The factory contract will handle the logic for creating new pairs, including setting the initial liquidity and configuring the pair's settings.
3. Liquidity Provider Contract: A liquidity provider contract is responsible for managing the liquidity provided by liquidity providers. The liquidity provider contract will handle the logic for adding and removing liquidity, as well as calculating the liquidity provider's share of the trading fees.
4. Oracle Contract: An oracle contract is responsible for providing price data to the CP-AMM contract. The oracle contract will handle the logic for fetching price data from external sources and providing it to the CP-AMM contract.
5. Governance Contract: A governance contract is responsible for managing the CP-AMM protocol's settings and configuration. The governance contract will handle the logic for proposing and voting on changes to the protocol's settings.

These periphery contracts will interact with the CP-AMM contract and other Uniswap V4 contracts to provide a complete and functional CP-AMM protocol.

Dependencies

- foundry: The Foundry contract development framework.
- forge-std: The Foundry standard library for contract development.
- openzeppelin-solidity: The OpenZeppelin Solidity library for contract development.
- @uniswap/v4-core: The Uniswap V4 core library that provides the necessary contracts and utilities.
- @uniswap/v4-sdk: The Uniswap V4 SDK that provides a convenient interface for interacting with the Uniswap V4 protocol.

Uniswap V4's use of hooks is an interesting aspect of its design. In the context of the CP-AMM project, hooks can be used to extend the functionality of the CP-AMM contract.

Hooks in Uniswap V4

In Uniswap V4, hooks are functions that can be called at specific points during the execution of a trade. These hooks allow developers to inject custom logic into the trading process.

Applying Hooks to the CP-AMM Project

To apply hooks to the CP-AMM project, you can define hook functions within the CP-AMM contract. These hook functions can then be called at specific points during the execution of a trade.
